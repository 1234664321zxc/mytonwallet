# MyTonWallet · [mytonwallet.io](https://mytonwallet.io)

**The most feature-rich web wallet and browser extension for the [TON Network](https://ton.org)** – with support of jettons, NFT, TON DNS, TON Sites, TON Proxy, and TON Magic.

The wallet is **self-custodial and safe**. The developers **do not** have access to funds, browser history or any other information. We focus on **speed**, **size** and **attention to detail**. We try to avoid using third-party libraries to ensure maximum reliability and safety, and also to lower the bundle size.
